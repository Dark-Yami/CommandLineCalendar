# CommandLineCalendar

  Overview & Purpose of Project
This project is a command-line-based calendar application, built in C#, Python, and JavaScript, that allows users to manage events in a local, offline environment. Users can view a monthly calendar, add events to specific dates, set reminders for upcoming events, and save all data in a local file, which makes it a lightweight and accessible tool for basic personal scheduling needs. The purpose of this project is to provide a simple yet functional calendar system that operates in the command line, eligible for learning file management, date handling, and basic UI in each language. It offers practical experience in building interactive CLI applications, working with local storage, and handling reminders for event-based applications.
  Project Goals
1.	Event Management: Provide a way for users to add, view, edit, and delete events associated with specific dates.
2.	Calendar View: Display a monthly view of dates and indicate which dates have scheduled events.
3.	Reminders: Enable users to set reminders for upcoming events.
4.	Local Storage: Store event data locally so it can be reloaded each time the app is opened.
  Technologies Used
•	C#: Leveraging C#'s .NET libraries to build the application with a focus on a strong command-line interface and efficient file I/O operations.
•	Python: Using Python's built-in libraries like datetime and json for date manipulation, event handling, and file storage.
•	JavaScript: Running the app in a Node.js environment, making use of Node’s file handling and date/time modules, to create a fast and responsive command-line app.
  Commands:
o	View Calendar: Shows the monthly view with marked events.
o	Add/Edit/Delete Event: Follow prompts to manage events.
o	Set Reminder: Use prompts to set a reminder for a specific event.
